            </p>
            <div class="answer">
              <p class="mb30">
                <span>A</span>OneHomes “homestay” grants an opportunity for guests from anywhere in the world to
                 interact with people from the local community.<br>
                There are two types of homestays dealt with by OneHomes:
              </p>
              <p class="mb30">1) Shared-living type<br>
                The host family lives in the same house as the guest for the duration of their stay.<br>
                2) Interactive type<br>
                The host family resides at a property nearby, while maintaining their availability to
                 interact with guests on a daily basis (e.g. when they live next door or another house on the same premises).
              </p>
              <p class="mb30">
                ------------<br>
                We do not call it a “homestay” if guests meet the host family only when checking-in or checking-out,
                 or if there is no direct communication between guests and host families.
              </p>
              <p class="mb30">
                <a href="#number3">Is the “Interactive type” also a homestay?: Is it included as a “homestay” even if the host does not live in the same house? ＞</a>
              </p>
            </div>
          </li>
          <li id="number3">
            <p class="question">
              <span>Q</span>Is the “Interactive type” also a homestay?: Is it included as a “homestay” even if the host does not live in the same house?
            </p>
            <div class="answer">
              <p class="mb30">
                <span>A</span>When we think of a homestay, we generally have the image of a “shared-living type”
                where you stay in a vacant room within the house where the host is living.
                This “shared-living type” is the main type dealt with by OneHomes.
              </p>
              <p class="mb30">On the other hand, there are many cases where, even if the host is not living in the property
                 they are loaning, such as a house built in the same site as their home or in a neighboring house they own,
                  they are in contact with their guests every day.
              </p>
              <p class="mb30">
                Cases where the host not only meets the guests at check-in/check-out, but goes out with them for sightseeing and meals,
                 provides information on recommendations in the areas, or interacts in the same way as the “shared-living type” are called
                  “interactive type” by OneHomes.
              </p>
              <p class="mb30">
                What we remember from our travels are the people we meet there.<br>
                At OneHomes, we introduce both “shared-living type” and “interactive type” homestays (private accommodation)
                 to provide our guests with opportunities to interact with people from the local community.
              </p>
            </div>
          </li>
          <li id="number4">
            <p class="question">
              <span>Q</span>Why does OneHomes deal exclusively with homestays?
            </p>
            <div class="answer">
              <p class="mb30">
                <span>A</span>The thing we most remember from our trips is not the scenery or food we eat, but the people we meet on our travels.
              </p>
              <p class="mb30">It is warm interaction with the local people at the heart of everyday life,
                 who kindly show you the way when you are lost or invite you for meals.
                 These are very different from those you meet when you are at tourist spots or shopping.
              </p>
              <p class="mb30">
                <em>At OneHomes, we believe that this is what makes a trip special.</em><br>
                Of course, going around “out of the ordinary” tourist spots is fun, but spending your whole trip doing that can be a bit of a waste.
              </p>
              <p class="mb30">
                Interact with the local people and become involved with their everyday life. <br>
                The way to change your trip into one of “unique” memories is a homestay where you stay at somebody’s house.
              </p>
              <p class="mb30">
                This is not limited to travelers from overseas, and people living in Japan as well can experience the warm interaction of a homestay.<br>
                We believe that the level of satisfaction in your trip will drastically change. OneHomes focuses on this kind of homestay.

            <p class="question">
              <span>Q</span>What are the attractions of a homestay? (as a guest)
            </p>
            <div class="answer">
              <p class="mb30">
                <span>A</span>The attractions of a homestay, more than anything else, are that
                <em>you can experience the normal lifestyle of local people, and you can interact with a host family who will warmly welcome you as a member of the family.</em>
              </p>
              <p class="mb30">
                A homestay is the only way that you can enjoy both the “undecorated everyday experience” and “interaction with local people”
                as a set with accommodation, which is something you cannot experience at hotels, “ryokan” Japanese-style inns,
                 or private accommodation where you do not meet the host.
              </p>
              <p class="mb30">
                Because of language and cultural barriers, it is usually difficult for foreign tourists to become friends with Japanese people
                during their trip. But with a homestay, from the instant the door is opened, the host family greets you as a member of the family.
              </p>
              <p class="mb30">
                Japanese travelers, as well, will get much more enjoyment by interacting with the local people rather than just visiting tourist spots.
              </p>
              <p class="mb30">
                Another attraction of homestays is that you can often stay there for a cheaper price than at a typical hotel or “ryokan”.
              </p>
              <p class="mb30">
                A homestay where you can enjoy the “everyday experience” and “interaction with the local people” at a reasonable charge will really improve your level of satisfaction in your trip.

              <p class="mb30">
                <span>A</span>As a host family, you can accept guests from all around the world,
                allowing you to connect with people from a variety of cultural backgrounds while staying in Japan,
                 making it an extremely attractive means of cultural interaction.
              </p>
              <p class="mb30">
                I want to interact with many people from around the world.<br>
                I want to rent out an empty room in my home and get income.<br>
                I want to repay the help I have received when traveling abroad to people coming to Japan.<br>
                I want to improve my ability in foreign languages.
              </p>
              <p class="mb30">
                There can be a variety of objectives when starting a host family. However, once you start the host family,
                 the fun of interacting with people from a wide range of countries always becomes the number one reason
                 to keep welcoming new guests.
              </p>
              <p class="mb30">
                Further, homestays, by welcoming guests from around the world, have the potential to help revitalize the local community.
              </p>
              <p class="mb30">
                Homestays can increase the number of fans of the local area by introducing local recommended spots
                and local events not listed in the guidebook, communicating to the traveler the charm of the local area
                in addition to the normal tourist spots.<br>
                As attraction of homestays is that you can act as a kind of “grassroots good will ambassador”, communicating the charm of the local area to the world.

                <span>A</span><em>1. Post accurate, up-to-date information that the guests need</em><br>
                It is important that information posted on your listing page, such as information on using guest rooms
                and facilities used by guests, points to note (for example, steps on road from closest station),
                and house rules etc. is accurate, up-to-date, and encompass all the information needed by the guests.
              </p>
              <p class="mb30">
                If the explanation is insufficient or the information is easily misunderstood,
                this can lead to problems. Register your listing page that considers the situation when guests actually stay.
              </p>
              <p class="mb30">
                <em>2. Post hobbies and interests of you and your family and the attractions of the local area</em><br>
                Guests want to interact with the host family and experience Japanese local lifestyles and culture.
              </p>
              <p class="mb30">
                It is highly recommended to post information about yourself and your family, such as interests and hobbies, and local information that is not found in the guidebook.
              </p>
              <p class="mb30">
                <em>Photos are of particular importance when appealing to guests!</em><br>
                Many guests will choose where they stay by looking at photos that attract them to the place.
              </p>
              <p class="mb30">
                Appeal using attractive photos that will make more guests want to stay with you for a homestay,
                such as photos of you and your family with your best smiles, photos of a pristinely cleaned home,
                and recommended spots in the local area.<br>

              <p class="mb30">
                <span>A</span>It is not necessary to have an expensive camera. You can take appealing photos just with your smartphone!
              </p>
              <p class="mb30">
                <em>1. The most important thing is the smiles of the host family!</em><br>
                Guests are always interested to know about the host family who they would be staying with.<br>
                Photos of a friendly host family with kind smiles are the best thing for attracting guests.
                 Ask the person who can take a photo for you to take the best shot of your family as a whole.
              </p>
              <p class="mb30">
                <em>2. Take photos during the daytime</em><br>
                The best photos are bright pictures using natural light or the light of the room, without requiring a flash.<br>
                If these are too bright, adjust the brightness using curtains or blinds.
              </p>
              <p class="mb30">
                <em>3. Make sure the camera is straight</em><br>
                Set the camera horizontally so the screen is not at a tilt.<br>
                If you can use the “grid” (auxiliary lines perpendicularly dividing the screen vertically and horizontally),
                this will be helpful in lining up the walls and furniture in parallel.
              </p>
              <p class="mb30">
                <em>4. Take unique photos that communicate the individuality of the host</em><br>
                What are the points recommending you or your family?<br>
                Take pictures of things that would recommend your home in an easy to understand way,
                such as your home garden or figure collection, or an event or activity that they can experience
                while staying at your home.
              </p>
              <p class="mb30">
                <em>5. We recommend landscape photos</em><br>
                Generally, landscape photos are better than portrait photos for expressing the breadth of the room.<br>
                If you are undecided whether to use take portrait or landscape photos, we would generally suggest taking landscape photos.
              </p>
              <p class="mb30">
                <em>6. The picture should be of a large size</em><br>
                If the size of the picture is too small, the image may be too rough, and difficult to see.<br>
                The standard is 1024 pixels horizontally x 683 pixels vertically.<br>
                Try publishing them on your listing page, and if they appear blurred, change them for a larger photo.
